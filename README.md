# Medical-Image-Segmentation
In this repo we have implemented various state-of-the-art techniques for Medical Image Segmentation and compared it with U-Net with MobileNetV2's performance on skin lesion and brain tumor datasets sourced from kaggle. This was done and implemented using Jupyter notebooks.
